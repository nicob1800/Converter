First python project, starting from very minimal knowledge.
Made for Orthobiologics team at Octane Medical Group.
Task was to take .tiff files of cells in different trays from a high resolution microscope and convert the frames into a video, showing their movement.
Files were not organized by tray, but by timestamp. Had to scrape the folders for the trays and arrange them by timestamp, and then turn into video.
Instead of just using cmd prompt for this project, I chose to make a UI with tkinter to start learning to use a new library.
MUCH room for improvement

# Converter
Converting .tif to .mp4
Must have imageJ installed

RUN IN CMD:
pip install opencv-python
pip install tkinter
